# ROLES IN CYPHERPOST

## The role of the server

Servers are best treated as ephermal/transitory servers. 

Servers are not meant for long term data storage.

Servers will seek to maintain the highest level of availability and data integrity regardless.

## The role of the client

Clients are designed to store and manage their data by themselves. 

Clients only use Servers as a means to pass data to other clients. 

Clients must always sign and verify data flowing to and from Servers. 

Clients that preserved and maintained their data can collaborate to create their own Server and recover their old network's history or a subset of it.

As such, the networks stablity is more dependent on its Clients rather than any Server.
